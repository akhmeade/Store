# ONLINE STORE



![Microservises scheme](architecture.jpg "Architecture")

## Architecture overview
* Blue microservices show the app's functionality via the REST API. To ensure horizontal scalability and fault tolerance, multiple instances of the same microservice can be started simultaneously. To be Autonomous, each microservice has its own database. However, all instances of the same microservice share the same database (which can be clustered). The JavaScript interface does not directly attack these 3 microservices: it passes through the front-end gateway API microservice, which also serves static resources (JavaScript code, HTML pages, and CSS).
* In green, we find the microservice infrastructure: Eureka services will allow microservices to register and then communicate without knowing their IP addresses in advance.

Each of the microservices is an app in the sense of Spring loading. Each of them has its own Maven module containing some Java classes and configuration files.

## List of services
* User service - the user service is responsible for being the authentication gateway for the online store application. 
* Account service - storing the account information of a user.
* Inventory service - the inventory and product catalogs in the online store.
* Shopping Cart Service - managing the products that a user has chosen to add to their online shopping cart.
* Discount Service - store information abiut discounts.
* Payment Service - information about payment methods.

1. The main microservices used:  
API-Gateway 
2. Auxiliary microservices:  
Account, Inventory, Discount, Shopping-cart, Payment

## Starting
Every microservice is a Spring Boot application and can be started locally using IDE or ../mvnw spring-boot:run command. Supporting services (Config and Discovery Server) must be started before any other application. 
If everything goes well, you can access the following services at given location:

Config Server - http://localhost:8888
Discovery Server - http://localhost:8761
AngularJS frontend (API Gateway) - http://localhost:8080

In order to start entire infrastructure using Docker, you have to build images by executing ./mvnw clean install -P buildDocker from a project root. Once images are ready, you can start them with a single command docker-compose up. Containers startup order is coordinated with dockerize script. After starting services it takes a while for API Gateway to be in sync with service registry, so don't be scared of initial Spring Cloud Gateway timeouts. You can track services availability using Eureka dashboard available by default at http://localhost:8761.

## Eureka Service directory
To communicate, microservices must know how to co-locate. In a microservices architecture hosted in the Cloud, we can hardly predict the number of instances of the same microservice (depending on the load) or even where they will be deployed (and therefore on which IP and which port they will be accessible). This is where the Eureka server comes into play : it will link microservices. 
Register at startup and periodically give sign of life (heartbeat every 30 seconds)
Retrieve the address of their adhesions from an identifier, in this case the name of the application declared via the property application.name of the boostrap.yml (loaded before application.properties)
Eureka is one of Netflix'S OSS projects supported by Spring Cloud.
Like what was done for the configuration server, it is necessary to implement an Eureka server (spring-petclinic-discovery-server module). 
The Eureka server comes with a small supervision interface accessible locally at the address http://localhost:8761/. The status of the different microservices and the number of instances 
are visible here :

## Calling a microservice
In OnlineStore, the microservice front API Gateway centralizes calls to the REST APIs of the microservices. It can be equated to a backend for frontend. It allows to manage the problems of CORS while ensuring load balancing.
The URL host has a special feature: it is not a domain name, server name, or even an IP address. Here we use the microservice ID that was used to register on the Eureka server.
Another special function concerns the name given to an instance of a component that implements the Spring MVC RestTemplate interface: loadBalanced RestTemplate .
In the Spring configuration of the ApiGatewayApplication microservice, the RestTemplate bean component is annotated with the Spring Cloud @LoadBalanced annotation.

## Route of calls
The front-end gateway API microservice centralizes browser calls. Although it can play the role of an aggregator, most calls are directly intended for microservices: we have 1 to 1. Developing REST controllers responsible for routing the request to the reverse side is of little interest. ,

To avoid any standard code, Spring Cloud Netflix suggests using the Zuul proxy . Activated using the @Enablesuulproxy annotation, Zull allows you to forward requests received from the gateway API back to microservices. It acts as a reverse proxy server (as Apache or Nginx would do).

## SpringBoot
Spring Boot Admin uses various drives offered by Spring Boot: heapdump, threadump, logging tools, scheduled tasksâ€¦ Starting with Spring Boot 2, for security reasons, only the status and information of the drives are displayed by default. Other execution mechanisms must be explicitly activated.

By selecting one of the 2 instances of customer service, you get access to various administrative tools, including, for example, monitoring resource consumption (memory, thread, processor).
Spring Boot Admin is not limited to displaying information in nice charts. The administrator can change the logging level of the Logback Logger. The level is changed immediately. No restart is required.
